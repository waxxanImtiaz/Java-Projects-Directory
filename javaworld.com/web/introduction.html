							Java is an <strong>object oriented programming language</strong> and a computing plateform platform.<br /><br />
                                                        There are many websites and applications that work on java.

						<p  class="text-justify">
							 Java is 99.99% object oriented.<br />
                                                         Java uses a formal OOP type system that must be obeyed at compile-time and run-time.
                                                         This is helpful for larger projects, where the structure helps keep the various parts consistent. <br />Contrast to Perl, which has a more anything-goes feel.

If Java is popular, then programs written in Java might promote non-Microsoft operating systems. For basically the same reason, all the nonMicrosoft vendors think Java is a great idea.</li>
                                                            <li>Microsoft's C# is very similar to Java, but with some improvements, and some questionable features added in, and it is not portable in the way Java is. Generally it is considered that C# will be successful in the way that Visual Basic is: a nice tool to build Microsoft only software.</li>

					<p class="h3"  class="header" style="cursor: default;">WORA (write once run anywhare)</p>
						<p  class="text-justify">
							When you write a program in C++ it is known as source code. The C++ compiler converts this source code into the machine code of underlying system (e.g. Windows) If you want to run that code on Linux you need to recompile it with a Linux based compiler. Due to the difference in compilers, sometimes you need to modify your code.<br />

                                                <p  class="text-justify">
                                                    Java has introduced the concept of WORA (write once run anywhere). When you write a java program it is known as the source code of java. The java compiler does not compile this source code for any underlying hardware system, rather it compiles it for a software system known as JVM (This compiled code is known as byte code). We have different JVMs for different systems (such as JVM for Windows, JVM for Linux etc). When we run our program the JVM interprets (translates) the compiled program into the language understood by the underlying system. So we write our code once and the JVM runs it everywhere according to the underlying system.<br />
